This is a perl6 module implementing some digest algorithms in pure Perl6 (no rakudo code).

So far only SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 are implemented.

Credits are indicated in the module header.  The code is mainly a translation
from javascript code, so it is not clear for me wether copyrights apply or not.

This work is published under the terms of the artistic license, as rakudo is.
